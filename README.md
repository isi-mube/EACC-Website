# EACC Website Prototype

A prototype website for the **European Advisory Committee of Cytotechnology (EACC)**, created within the **EFCS** environment.

## Purpose of the Website

In Europe, there are about 4000 Cytotechnologists. Without their constant and dedicated work, the fight against cervical cancer would be impossible. The goal of this website is to increase communication and collaboration among cytotechnological delegates from all countries in Europe, under the auspices of the **European Federation of Cytology Societies (EFCS)**.

## Main Features

- **EACC Committee Members**
- **Regulations of the EACC**
- **Cytology Resources and Links**
- **Interactive Slide Seminar** from the European Congress of Cytology in Lisbon, 2009

These sections currently provide the basic information for EACC members and cytotechnologists across Europe. More features or content may be added in the future to expand the scope of the website.

## EACC Regulations

The **European Advisory Committee of Cytotechnology (EACC)** aims to support and regulate the cytotechnologist profession across Europe. The committee is composed of members, a chairperson, and a secretary.

### Key Regulations:

- The EACC is responsible for organizing the **European Special Session for Cytotechnologists** during the **European Congress of Cytology**.
- The **Annual EACC meeting** takes place during each European Congress of Cytology. At least half of the members must be present or represented to make voting decisions.
- Decisions are taken by a simple majority of votes, and the chairperson holds the casting vote in the event of a tie.
- Non-members can attend the meetings only with approval from the chairperson and the secretary, but they do not have voting rights.
